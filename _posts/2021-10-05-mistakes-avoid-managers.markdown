As a new or even experienced manager, we are vulnerable to making mistakes. Some of the mistakes you made seem like silly mistakes that could be avoided if you know the rules or make more preparation. [While it is very good to be brilliant, it is easier to avoid mistakes](https://fs.blog/2014/06/avoiding-stupidity/). **The less you make mistakes, the better your performance will be**. Here are the things that you might want to know to avoid mistakes.

## Not Enough Managing Up
As a manager, you will need to manage both up and down. It is kinda obvious, but sometimes it is forgotten or not knowing how to manage up since a manager's time and attention is much bigger in managing down.

There are numerous ways to manage up. Some of them are:

- Report progress of your commitment periodically. Work with your manager to find the sweet spot on how and when is the reporting. The principle is that the more urgent the commitment, the higher of the reporting frequency
- Escalate important issues quickly. The last thing your manager wants is knowing important issues late when they can help with the issues. Try to define some issues that need to be escalated instantly. e.g. Resignation, major incident, or any personal emergency

## Not Available Enough
I know you are busy, but if you are not available, especially to your direct reports, it will be downright harmful for your relationship. **Postponing or cancelling 1 on 1 and late or no reply is two of the most common symptoms of not being available.**

You need to position yourself that you are available to them to reduce the barrier to reach you. You do not want your direct report not reaching you out because they feel you are very busy. Here are some ways to make yourself more available:

- Reduce your number of commitments. Work with your manager to decide the right amount of commitment. Also prioritize your work and ask yourself: “is it really urgent?”, “can it be postponed?”, “can it be delegated?”, “should I drop it instead?”. You can use Eisenhower’s Urgent/Important Principles
- Reduce the meeting you attend. Always try to settle things asynchronously first. Ask for the meeting brief before you go to the meeting. Some meetings may be avoided just by discussing it via text chats beforehand
- Have at least a couple hours of free time each day. The number may vary for each manager, but 3-4 hours work well for me. This makes me able to reply to things in a timely manner and have instant sporadic discussion when someone reaches out to me

Free time does not mean you do not work. It is the time that you are not inside a meeting and able to work on things that can be done asynchronously. 

## Not Following Up
A lot of projects have little to no progress because no one is following up. The second problem is that you also did not follow up with the assigned action item or commitment. This is considered an amateur's mistake because this shows that you lack discipline and proper work system while you need to be the role model. Here are some tips:

- Keep track of all your commitments. There are a lot of apps that can accommodate this need. Take a moment to write it to your tracking document or app.
- Escalate to stakeholders when things are not going as expected. Course correct things as soon as they go south. This keeps the project moving forward

## Not Communicating Enough
Welcome to management, where you need to talk about certain things numerous times and people still do not understand what you really mean. You cannot expect by talking it once to all people then instantly they got your message. This is some more effective way:

- Use a lot of communication channels while sending a message. Use all the channels you can afford. Slack, email, DM, 1 on 1, and work ritual to send the message
- Talk about it constantly. Especially on 1 on 1’s. 1 on 1 discussion about certain things is one the most effective way to send a message
- Ask the recipient to repeat the message. In some rare cases, you want to ensure the message is clear to certain people. You can ask like “I want us to be on the same page. Could you please repeat what you understand?”, or “Would you rephrase that for me?”

## Not Setting The Right Expectations
Every commitment you own needs clear and concrete deliverables, acceptance criteria, and timeline that is agreed by all stakeholders, especially your manager. If not, prepare to be disappointed. Here are the things you might want to do besides deciding the deliverable, acceptance criteria, and timeline:

- Write it down. Put all the details of the project in a written document and make sure all parties refer to the document. Email also works
- Setup a routine progress update. Similar to the managing up section. Either you are the stakeholder or the executor, you want progress update periodically to let you course correct quickly

## Not Auditing Enough
You need to verify the work of your team. It does not mean you do not trust your team. You need to verify because at the end of the day, **you are fully accountable for the squad’s output and process.** You want to know really quickly when something is not up to our standard inside the team before any incident happens.

Besides of course preparing safeguard automatically and having automation tools to check, **you want to audit your system periodically.** I usually do it once every month or quarter. Especially when you did not review all changes in your system. For newer projects or development, consider reviewing most if not all changes to ensure the quality.

All the things that are mentioned here are not the hard things about management. These things need decent preparation, simple processes, and discipline.
